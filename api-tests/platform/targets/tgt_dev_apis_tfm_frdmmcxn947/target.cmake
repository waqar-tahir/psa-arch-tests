# Now this is a major hack, but there is no way to get a 
# platform specific header file (this platform overrides 
# tfm_builtin_key_ids.h) included here. Even if the header 
# file is part of TF-M's install interface, this is still 
# not an option as the test suite typically is part of the 
# TF-M build itself which means the install has not yet 
# happened and the interface files are only at their source 
# location but not at the install location.
# So we need that platform specific include path here which 
# depends on the file structure in TF-M (which probalby is 
# reasonably stable at this point)...
