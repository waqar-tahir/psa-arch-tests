// Range of 1KB Non-volatile memory to preserve data over reset.
// This is an emulation in RAM. It uses the last 1Kib of RAM available to NS.
// Note, that RAM usage for NS is restricted, the value here must match up with
// The value that TF-M allows for NS (see also
trusted-firmware-m\platform\ext\target\nxp\rdrw61x\partition\region_defs.h).
// The size available to NS also needs to be known to the linker when building 
// NS projects. When building this application, it is recommended to not allow 
// usage of the memory used for nvmem emulation. How to achieve this depends on 
// the build system.
// For zephyr builds usually a _ns board configuration holds the available memory 
// for the NS partition. 
// Such settings split over multiple repositories tend to de-sync, so please take 
// care and the following numbers with extra-caution!
